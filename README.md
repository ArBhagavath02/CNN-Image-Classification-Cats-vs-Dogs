# CNN Image Classification: Cats vs Dogs

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset used contains labeled images of cats and dogs, and the goal is to develop an efficient model that can accurately distinguish between the two classes.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Cat and Dog Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dZvL1gi5QLwOGrfdn9XEsi4EnXx535bD?usp=drive_link)
- **Classes**: 
  - Cats (label: 0)
  - Dogs (label: 1)
- **File Format**: JPEG images
- **Image Size**: Varies (will be resized to a standard size during preprocessing)

## Libraries Used
- **TensorFlow**: To build and train the CNN model.
- **Keras**: For higher-level API for defining layers and models.
